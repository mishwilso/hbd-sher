            Dear Sher,
          </p>
          
          <p>
Every day, I am so grateful that I dropped that pencil on the floor and that you were the person to pick it up. Youâ€™re truly the greatest friend I could have ever asked for. If I didnâ€™t believe in soulmates before, I definitely believe in them now. ðŸ’–          </p>
          
          <p>
I built this little corner of the internet just for you (it's a mess, but Iâ€™ll clean up later) because a) Iâ€™m broke and very far away, so I canâ€™t hug you,  b) you deserve to have a website dedicated to you. Everything I built is a sort of reference to conversations or moments we share- from deciding on what anime to watch, doing pomodoro sessions together, or the infamous yaoi library that you speak of so often. ðŸŒ¸
          </p>
          
          <p>
I love you dearly and all that you bring. I love your rants, even when theyâ€™re about nothing in particular. I love how hypotheticals, no matter how improbable they are. I love laughing at and with you, even when the joke has long since passed. You make my life better in more ways than I can describe, and I hope I do the same for you.  âœ¨
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Thank you for being exactly who you are. Thank you for every late-night conversation, every inside joke, every moment of pure joy. You are irreplaceable, and I am so incredibly lucky to call you my best friend.
          </p>
          
          <p>
This is your space. Thereâ€™s definitely more to come; my skills arenâ€™t quite there yet. I hope you have a great time while youâ€™re here.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg font-medium">
            Love you forever and always,<br />
            Mish ðŸ’•
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground italic text-center pt-4">
            P.S. â€” You're stuck with me forever. I'll sue if you leave me. ðŸ˜˜
          </p>
